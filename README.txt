This project has been a practice of SQL basics on a database of worlds populations by CodeCademy.

This project attempted to answer these questions from the specification of the project: 


1. What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).


2. What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?


3.What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?


4.What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

5.How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

6. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?
